This txt file is to help you understand the structure of the project. It is separated by the name of the file to make it easy to understand.

- requirements.txt

Before everything, you have to install the libs in your environment. I recommend installing them with the command "uv pip install -r requirements.txt" if you have uv on your computer.
If you don’t have it, install uv first with "pip install uv", or you can install the libs with "pip install -r requirements.txt".

- gui_streamlit.py

The script is easy to understand. It uses the voice_calc.py code, adapted for the Streamlit library and integrated with the fine-tuned model. The Whisper model is already included in the folder, but if you'd like to download it directly from the Hugging Face repository, just send me a message. You can also choose to train your own model, since the training_script follows the same parameters as the original training. The code is straightforward and easy to personalize for your own needs.

To run the GUI, you have to write this in the terminal: "streamlit run gui_streamlit.py" or "streamlit run your_path/gui_streamlit.py"

- training_script.py

Before running the training_script, create a .env file and insert the line containing the path to your data. I recommend using this example:
data_path = "your_path/whisper-math/data"

The training script is easy to understand, but reading is required. The code itself does not process the separation of the English part from the Arabic; it only imports using the os library (get_audio_file_paths and dataset_g)
and processes with the Whisper processor (generate_audio_dataset and preprocess_function). For training, I used the same functions from the Whisper fine-tuning tutorial to speed up the process and the Hugging Face Trainer to simplify implementation, as it is a PyTorch wrapper. The code has comments to separate which parts do what, but you can understand more about the model by reading the link below.

The pre-processed data, organized into English and Arabic, is included in the folder.
